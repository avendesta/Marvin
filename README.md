scraper for the website sustainabledevelopment.un.org

  How it works:
- You first enter the page number you want to scrape into 'pages.txt' file. One number per line
- Then you run the script `scraper.py`
- Running the script will give you a file named 'information.csv' and 'information.xlsx'

  How to run:

```
# make sure you're on the main directory
> pip install -r requirements.txt  # this will install all the necessary libraries
> python scraper.py
```
